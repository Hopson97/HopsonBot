## Features

### Command System

Hopson Bot has commands split into multiple categories, which can be seen from the `>help` command

To access the commands of the categories, the user must put the category name followed by the command. 

For example, to access the `role` commands, the user must do `>role <command here>`

"Default" commands do not require this, for example 8ball and source command do not require a category prefix.

#### Role commands

Role commands are for changing your roles, as well as seeing how many people have a certain role.
